# DevMountain Project - Timeline

## Description 
Timeline is a simple photo sharing service, which is comparable to a simplified version of Instagram. This culminates many concepts that I have learned, and it adds more complex data modeling, an Image Picker, CloudKit, and protocol-oriented programming to make a Capstone Level project spanning multiple days and concepts.

## What I Learned

* How to follow a project planning framework to build a development plan
* Develop project planning framework to prioritize and manage project progress
* Implement basic data model
* Use staged data to prototype features
* Implement search using a system search controller
* Use an image picker controller and activity controller
* Use container views to abstract shared functionality into a single view controller
* Save data to CloudKit
* Fetch data from CloudKit
* Query data from CloudKit
* Use subscriptions to generate push notifications
* Use push notifications to run a push based sync engine
